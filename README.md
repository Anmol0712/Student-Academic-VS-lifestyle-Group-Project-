# 📚 Student Academic vs Lifestyle Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the relationship between **students' academic performance** and their **lifestyle choices**.  
The goal is to identify patterns and insights that explain how study habits, health, and social activities affect academic results.  

Key questions explored:  
- How does lifestyle influence academic performance?  
- What are the strongest predictors of student success?  
- Can we classify or predict student outcomes using lifestyle indicators?

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **Python** 
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning models  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Analysis & experimentation

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Normalization where required  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of academic vs lifestyle factors  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Visual insights through plots  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Random Forest Classifier (main model)  
   - Train-test split for validation  
   - Model tuning and evaluation  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion Matrix

## 🎯 Why Random Forest?  
Random Forest was chosen because:  
- It performs well on both categorical and numerical features.  
- It reduces overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees.  
- It provides **feature importance**, helping identify key lifestyle factors impacting academics.

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Lifestyle choices (such as study hours, sleep, and social activities) showed strong correlations with academic performance.  
- The Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy and balanced precision/recall.  
- Key lifestyle predictors of academic success were identified.
